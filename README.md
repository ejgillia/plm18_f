our project consist of making the following card games:

	bartok
		played by using the command python3 bartok.py
		example gameplay can be found in the BartokExample directory
	
	presidents
		played by using the command pyhton3 presidents.py
		example gameplay can be found in the PresidentsExample directory

both games have built in AI and are set up for a single human user. 
In addition, both games print out available plays to the human user so that beginers can easily play the game.
