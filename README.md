Our project consist of making the following card games:

	Bartok
		played by using the command 
        ```
        python3 bartok.py
        ```
		example gameplay can be found in the BartokExample directory
	
	Presidents
		played by using the command 
        ```
        python3 presidents.py
        ```
		example gameplay can be found in the PresidentsExample directory

Both games have built-in AI and are set up for a single human user. 
In addition, both games print out available plays to the human user so that beginners can easily play the game.
