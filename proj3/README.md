Our project (3) consist of making the following card games:

	Bartok
        example gameplay can be found in the BartokExample directory
		played by using the command:
```python
python3 bartok.py
```
	
	Presidents
        example gameplay can be found in the PresidentsExample directory
		played by using the command:
```python
python3 presidents.py
```

Both games have built-in AI and are set up for a single human user. 
In addition, both games print out available plays to the human user so that beginners can easily play the game.
